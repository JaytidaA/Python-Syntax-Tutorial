Another special data structure used to hold multiple elements is known as a "Tuple". The main difference between Lists and Tuples is that a Tuple is immutable in nature. Meaning that the **Values of a Tuple cannot be changed after declaration**.

A tuple is declared as follows:
```python
vector = (3, 4, 12)
```
## Tuple Functions
A tuple supports the following functions:
1. `index()`
2. `count()`
Both of these work in the same way as the string variants of these functions.
