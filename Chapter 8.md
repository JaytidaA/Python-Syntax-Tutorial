Methods/Functions are an indispensable part of programming, they allow you to group related parts of code together, increase the ability to reuse code and enables abstraction.

Here is how you define a method:
```python
# Function declaration and definition
def foo([optional parameters]):
	# Code Block to be executed
	return bar # Return Statement

# Function call
foo()
```
