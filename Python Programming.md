Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language. It is dynamically typed which means that the data types of variables are not decided during their declaration.


# Chapter 0: Prerequisites
You can run python code in two ways.
1. Writing code in a `.py` file and then using the command: 
```bash
python3 app.py
```
2. Using the python command-line interpreter

## Print Method
We can use the `print()` method to print out whatever is inside the parenthesis to the terminal
```python
print("Hello World")
```
## Comments in Python
Python Comments are denoted by the `#`(hash) character
```python
# This is a python comment
```
## User Input
We use the `input` method along with an optional `propmpt` to get user-input. It returns the value returned from the standard input stream
```python
string1 = input("Enter a string")
```
By default, every item received from the input method will be a string so we must cast the value returned to obtain the correct values.
```python
num1 = float(input("Enter a number"))
# Casting to a 'float' data type
```
