Real numbers in Python are represented by either the `int` or the `float` classes.

## Basic Arithmetic Operators
1. `+`: Addition
2. `-`: Subtraction
3. `*`: Multiplication
4. `/`: Division
5. `%`: Modulus
6. `**`: Exponentiation

Apart from these operations, there are plenty of mathematical operations and functions predefined in python and present in libraries such as `Math` or `numpy`.
