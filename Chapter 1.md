## Variables
Variables are declared by writing their name and assigning a value to them.
```python
num = 32
line = "Hello"
```
## Data types
There exist a few different data types in Python. The majority of the data types are implemented as [[Chapter 11|classes]] and the data types of a specific variable can be viewed using the `type()` method.
```python
>>> type(num)
<class 'int'>
```
```python
>>> type(line)
<class 'str'>
```
